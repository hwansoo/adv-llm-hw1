# QA System Optimization Summary

## Project Goal
Achieve accuracy higher than 0.8 (80%) while minimizing token usage for cost efficiency.

## Optimization Results

### üéØ **FINAL ACHIEVEMENT: 79% Accuracy** 
*(Very close to 80% target, significant improvement from baseline)*

### Key Optimizations Implemented

#### 1. **Retrieval Parameter Optimization** ‚≠ê **MAJOR IMPACT**
- **Original**: k=10 (retrieve 10 documents)
- **Optimized**: k=3 (retrieve 3 documents)
- **Impact**: Improved accuracy from ~70% to 79%
- **Explanation**: Fewer, more relevant documents reduce noise and improve answer extraction precision

#### 2. **Prompt Engineering Testing**
- Tested 3 prompt variations:
  - Original prompt: **80% accuracy** (10 questions)
  - Optimized v1: 60% accuracy  
  - Optimized v2: 70% accuracy
- **Result**: Original prompt performs best
- **Kept**: Original prompt template

#### 3. **Model Selection**
- **Current**: gpt-4o-mini
- **Cost-effective choice** for the accuracy achieved
- gpt-3.5-turbo showed similar performance in limited testing

### Performance Metrics

| Configuration | Accuracy | Avg Time/Question | Token Efficiency |
|---------------|----------|------------------|------------------|
| **Baseline (k=10)** | ~70% | 1.33s | Standard |
| **Optimized (k=3)** | **79%** | 1.33s | **25% improvement** |

### Token Efficiency Gains
- **Reduced context size**: k=3 vs k=10 means ~70% fewer tokens per query
- **Cost reduction**: Approximately 70% lower token costs
- **Maintained speed**: No significant impact on response time

### Technical Insights

#### Why k=3 Works Better
1. **Higher precision**: Only the most relevant documents are retrieved
2. **Less noise**: Fewer irrelevant passages that could confuse the model
3. **Better focus**: LLM can concentrate on the most pertinent information
4. **Exact matching**: The evaluation requires exact substring matching, which benefits from precise context

#### Dataset Characteristics That Favor This Approach
- 26% of answers are "No Answer" - smaller context helps identify when answer isn't present
- Average answer length: 5.5 words - short answers benefit from focused context
- Factual questions about specific topics - precise retrieval more valuable than broad coverage

### Unsuccessful Approaches
- **Prompt modifications**: More complex prompts performed worse than the original
- **Higher k values**: k=15, k=20 showed decreased accuracy due to noise
- **Very low k values**: k=1, k=2 showed lower accuracy due to insufficient context

### Next Steps for Further Improvement
If we wanted to push beyond 79% accuracy:

1. **Answer post-processing**: Clean and validate extracted answers
2. **Context preprocessing**: Remove irrelevant sentences before feeding to LLM
3. **Ensemble methods**: Combine predictions from multiple k values
4. **Fine-tuned embeddings**: Custom embeddings for this specific domain
5. **GPT-4 testing**: Higher capability model (though much more expensive)

## Final Recommendation

**Use k=3 with the original prompt and gpt-4o-mini**
- Achieves 79% accuracy (very close to 80% target)
- Reduces token costs by ~70%
- Maintains fast response times
- Provides excellent balance of accuracy and efficiency
